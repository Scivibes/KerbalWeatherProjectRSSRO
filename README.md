Kerbal Weather Project (KWP) is a groundbreaking weather and climate mod for KSP. In KWP, weather and climate data from a global circulation model ([MPAS](https://mpas-dev.github.io/)) were incorporated into KSP gameplay through a C# plugin. More information about KWP is available at the [mod webpage](https://kerbalwxproject.space).
